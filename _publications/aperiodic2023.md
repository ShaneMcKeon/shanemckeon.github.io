ABSTRACT  
Postmortem animal and human models suggest changes through adolescence in aspects of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic function (E/I) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) suggestive of critical period plasticity at a time of significant cognitive development. Recently, using high field 7T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI), we found in vivo evidence for increases in PFC glutamate/GABA balance through adolescence into adulthood. We now extend these MRSI findings by investigating, in the same 164 10â€“ 32-year-old participants, its correspondence with EEG aperiodic activity, an independent measure of E/I balance elucidating changes in neural activity. Results showed decreases in PFC aperiodic activity from adolescence to adulthood, that were associated with MRSI measures of glutamate/GABA balance as well as mediating the association between age and EEG aperiodic activity. Further, changes in aperiodic activity predicted performance on a working memory task, indicating a role for E/I based changes in PFC signaling mechanisms in supporting maturation of cognitive control. Taken together, these results suggest that PFC is undergoing critical period plasticity through adolescence evident in both neurotransmitter and neural function that supports cognitive development.
