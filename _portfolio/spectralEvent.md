    Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory (WM) continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (35â€“65 Hz) during the WM delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal-driven behavior. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma events, more so than sustained activity, may underlie WM maintenance during the delay period. However, developmental differences in gamma events during WM have not been studied. Here, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related differences in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds.
