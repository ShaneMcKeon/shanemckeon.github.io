ABSTRACT  
Adolescence begins with the onset of puberty and is characterized by unique neurobiological and cognitive development, supporting improved executive function, increased inhibitory control, and the continual refinement of behavior. Associated with sensation seeking, risk- taking behavior, peer and parental influence, substance use, and increased vulnerability to psychopathology. During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant specialization in structure and function, including synaptic pruning, myelination, and connectivity. Previous developmental studies have shown maturational fluctuations, such as increased white matter integrity, prefrontal GABA concentration increases, and significant decreases in frequency band power across age in all frequency bands. To better understand brain maturation during adolescence, we investigated developmental changes in transient EEG activity
