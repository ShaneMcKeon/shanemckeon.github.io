I am a 5th year Bioengineering PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh with a focus in adolescent neuroimaging. My current work aims to integrate multimodal neuroimaging and neural recording data to assess neural function to characterize neurocognitive development through adolescence.

### Research Interests
My PhD thesis focuses on the following three aims: 1) assess the neural underpinnings of improved executive function, modeled in our WM task (Aim 1), and 2) investigate EEG-derived measures of the E/I balance and their associations with 7T Magnetic Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) derived measures of GABA and glutamate (Aim 2), that will be supported by invasive stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) recordings (Aim 3).  

After my PhD, I would like to focus on more clinical realms of research, including using neuroimaging, whether that be EEG, MRI, PET, etc, for mental health diagnoses and/or using AI in combination with neuroimaging to match patients with the appropriate and most likley to be successful medication.
