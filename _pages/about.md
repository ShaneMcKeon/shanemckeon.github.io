## About Me
I am postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pittsburgh studying bioengineering with a focus on using neuroimaging to study adolescent development. I received my Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering, a minor in Neuroscience, and a certificate in Conceptual Foundations of Medicine from the University of Pittsburgh,  graduating in Spring 2019. During this time I was an active member of the co-ed engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, becoming vice regent in my senior year, as well as the Bio Medical Engineering Society (BMES).

## Work Experience

<b> PhD Candidate, NRSA F31 Fellow </b>  
The University of Pittsburgh, Laboratory of Neurocognitive Development  
Advisor: Dr. Beatriz Luna  
August 2019 – Present  
- Developed a MATLAB pipeline to assess trial level transient events of EEG activity to investigate the neural underpinnings of improved executive function during our memory guided saccade working memory task, resulting in two conference presentations and a publication in NeuroImage.
- Implemented a python pipeline to assess aperiodic resting state EEG activity to investigate EEG-derived measures of the excitatory/inhibitory balance, their associations with 7-Tesla spectroscopy measures of GABA and glutamate, and working memory, resulting in three conference presentations and a publication under review.
- Built a MATLAB protocol to calculate the evoked and spontaneous power of derived from EEG activity during an auditory steady state stimuli to assess cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as an indirect measure of the excitatory/inhibitory balance, resulting in two conference presentations and a publication in prep.
- Developing a MATLAB pipeline to assess entropy in stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG)

<b> Undergraduate Research Assistant </b>  

The University of Pittsburgh, Geriatric Psychiatry Neuroimaging Lab  
May 2017 – August 2019  
Advisor: Howard Aizenstein, MD, PhD	
- Created a nonlinear registration method to align postmortem histology samples to in-vivo T1 and T2 weighted MRIs and ex-vivo T1 weighted MRI using MATLAB and FSL to correlate in-vivo white matter hyperintensities with post-mortem histology resulting in four conference presentations.
- Developed a protocol to evaluate the segmentation performance of 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer and SPM, resulting in a conference presentation.


&nbsp;&nbsp;

The University of Pittsburgh, Clinical Applications of Neuroscience Lab  
January 2018 – May 2019  
Advisor: Rebecca Price, PhD
- Developed a MATLAB script that analyzed eye tracking data and reported the number of times the participant blinked, the average duration of a blink, the number of fixations, and the average time of a fixation.
- Assisted in patient recruitment for a compulsive behavior study and a depression treatment clinical trial

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Milcarek Lab  
The University of Pittsburgh  
January 2016 – May 2016  
Advisor: Christine Milcarek, PhD
- Hypothesized that the transition in expression of ELL3 to ELL2 is important in the development of B cells into antibody secreting plasma cells (ASCs)
- Responsible for gel electrophoresis, western blotting, and data analysis
- Used chemiluminescence to prove which cell lines contained ELL3 and/or ELL2 


&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b> Undergraduate Research Intern </b>  
The Biomedical Institute of NJ
