## About Me
I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh studying bioengineering with a focus on using neuroimaging to study adolescent development. I received my Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering, a minor in Neuroscience, and a certificate in Conceptual Foundations of Medicine from the University of Pittsburgh,  graduating in Spring 2019. During this time I was an active member of the co-ed engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, becoming vice regent in my senior year, as well as the Bio Medical Engineering Society (BMES).

I was born and raised in Morristown, NJ. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, taking my dog on hikes, and rock climbing.

Undergraduate Researcher  
Clinical Applications of Neuroscience Lab  
The University of Pittsburgh  
January 2018 – May 2019  
Project: Analyzing the relationship between eye tracking and fMRI data during negative stimulus
- Developed a MATLAB script that analyses eye tracking data and reports the number of times the participant blinks, the average duration of a blink, the number of fixations, and the average time of a fixation.
- Assisted in the preprocessing of fMRI data
