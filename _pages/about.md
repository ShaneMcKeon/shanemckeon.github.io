## About Me
I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh studying bioengineering with a focus on using neuroimaging to study adolescent development. I received my Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering, a minor in Neuroscience, and a certificate in Conceptual Foundations of Medicine from the University of Pittsburgh,  graduating in Spring 2019. During this time I was an active member of the co-ed engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, becoming vice regent in my senior year, as well as the Bio Medical Engineering Society (BMES).

I was born and raised in Morristown, NJ. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, taking my dog on hikes, and rock climbing.
